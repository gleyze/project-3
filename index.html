    K-pop girl group NewJeans released a new promotional single ‘Zero’, in collaboration with Coca-Cola on April 3rd. 
    The track was released in collaboration with Coca-Cola for its Coca-Cola Zero campaign in South Korea. 
    The song has peaked at #1 in Korean charts, but this is not new for them as their previous songs like <project-3 filename='../assets/DITTO.mov'>Ditto</project-3> and <project-3 filename='../assets/OMG.mov'>OMG</project-3> have been a hit in Korea and globally. 
    The chorus for the song ‘Zero’ actually takes inspiration from an old Korean nursery rhyme that dates back to the 1940’s. 
    In 'Zero's' chorus, the lyrics <project-3 filename='../assets/newJeansVer.mov'>"Coca Cola Mashita"</project-3> can be heard. 
    This is actually the first line of the nursery rhyme. 
    This nursery rhyme was used among children when trying to make a choice, which basically means its the Korean version of 
    eeny, meeny, miny, moe. <project-3 filename='../assets/firstRhyme.mov'>"Coca Cola Mashita"</project-3> means "Coca Cola is delicious". 
    The second line to the nursery rhyme, if you want to make the song longer, is  <project-3 filename='../assets/secondRhyme.mov'>"Mashiseumyeon ddo meokji"</project-3>
    which means "If its delicious, I'll eat it again", this basically serves as the Korean version of "Catch a tiger by its toe".
    This is a <project-3 filename='../assets/fart.mp3'>fart sound</project-3> and a <project-3 filename='../assets/monkeys.mp3'> monkey sound </project-3> if you've read until this far. teehee.
